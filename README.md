*App UI*

# Technologies
- Core application written in **C#**
- Autocorrelation function implemented in **C++**
- UI designed in **WPF**

# Functionalities
- Maps audio samples exported from Audacity from 32-bit to either 8 or 10-bits
- Software exists because of a project that required such data to be uploaded to an Arduino Uno board in order to test its processing capabilities

## Note
- It can currenly only process m
